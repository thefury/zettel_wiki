:stoicism:

Premeditation of evils (premeditatio malorum) is a stoic technique of envisioning
all of the negative things that can happen to you. Examples could include: what would
it be like to lose my job? To become homeless? To lose my family and friends to the
plague?

By imagining the worst case scenarios ahead of time, the stoics believed that they
could overcome their fears of negative experiences. They would be able to consider how
they would handle failure as well as how they would handle success. What happens if 
things go wrong tomorrow? How do I act today to help prepare for this?

What do you want to avoid? This is a wonderful way to improve yourself.

Also known as Negative Visulaization.
