:mental-model:

Inversion is a questioning technique that can allow you to see a problem from
multiple angles. Instead of thinking of good solutions, think of bad outcomes 
and think "How can we aviod these outcomes"? This technique can also help with
avoiding worst-case scenarios.


Good Questions:

- What if the opposite were true?
- What is the worst that can happen here? How do I avoid that?
- Is the inverted state actually preferable in some way?
