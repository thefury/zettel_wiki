:ideation:business:

1. Find a zap that you find interesting
2. Could be one that people are complaining about or using a lot
3. Create a custome app that does what Zapier does for that one zap.

This works because you are finding a few things. 

- you know there is a market for it - people are using it
- you know that people are paying for it - it's not a free service
- you have the algorithm right in front of you

In a nutshell: find with the nocoders are doing, and then code it.
