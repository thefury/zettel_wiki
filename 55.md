# Summary

An approval test is a simple test that shows that the results of a function (or executable) has not
changed. While a full unit test suite would be preferrable in most cases, an approval test allows the
prgorammer to simply wrap the test subject. It can be seen as a sort of black box test.

{{{go
type ComplexObject struct {
  Name string
  Slug string
}

func longComplexBuilder() ComplexObject {
  co := ComplexObject{}
  
  // does some major and configuration
  
  return co
}

func test_approveComplexObject(t *testing.T) {
  goldenmaster := ComplexObject{Name: "name", Slug: "a-name"}  
  co := longComplexBuilder()
  if co != goldenMaster {
  t.Error("not good")
  }
}

}}}

Other names for approval tests are: characterization tests, golden-master, and snapshot testing.
