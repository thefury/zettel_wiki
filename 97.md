X I've made my reservation
X I'm leaving town tomorrow
X I'll find somebody new and
X there'll be no more sorrow

That's what I do each time But I can't follow through

I'll be watching you
Though you make me cry
I'll be watching you
I can't say goodbye

No, I'll never, never breakaway from you
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I make a vow to myself
You and I are through
Nothing can change my mind
I'm sorry, just won't do

That's what I say each time
But I can't follow through

I'll be watching you
Though you make me cry
I'll be watching you
I can't say goodbye

No I'll never, never breakaway from you
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Even though you treat me bad
And many cruel words are spoken
You have got a spell on me
That just can't be broken, no, no

I take your picture down
And throw it away, yeah
There'll be no baby now
For you to call each day

That's what I say each time
But I can't follow through

I'll be watching you
Though you make me cry
I'll be watching you
I can't say goodbye

No, I'll never, never breakaway from you
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I'll be watching you
Though you make me cry
I'll be watching you
I can't say goodbye

No, I'll never, never breakaway from you
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I'll be watching you
I'll be watching you
I'll be watching you
