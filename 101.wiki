:research:reading:

One method of becoming an active reader is to critically look at all technical material,
whether it is software, an article, or a research talk, and ask questions about not only
the material, but also the framework in which the information sits.

= Canonical Questions =

  * From where did the author seem to draw the ideas?
  * What exactly was accomplished by this piece of work?
  * How does it seem to relate to other work in the field?
  * What would be the reasonable next step to build upon this work?
  * What ideas from related fields might be brought to bear upon this subject?

If you are interested in keeping this knowledge in preparation for either writing or for
surfacing a research question, it is a good idea to keep a log of these answers. This seems
to be a perfect case for [[54|zettelkasten]] style notes
