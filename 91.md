:knowledge:

"Just tell me what to do"

This seems to work best on books that give adivice, for instance technical of self-help
books and articles. By boiling down all of the information into a simple directive, you
are effectively summarizing the knowledge.

1. create your notes as normal
2. extract the most essential and counterintuitive points
3. turn the observation into advice - this is the hardest part

Sivers gives the following example:

“Behavioral psychologists Stephen M. Garcia and Avishalom Tor showed that merely knowing there are more competitors in a competition decreases our performance.” 
becomes:

“Avoid awareness of competitors.”
