:knowledge:

This is a note taking and keeping strategy that is related to, but simpler than, 
[zettelkasten](54). By separating notes into the four areas, you can keep notes quickly
and easily.

- Project: 
  - A series of tasks linked with a goal or timeline
  - e.g. write blog post on notes, finalize documentation on this thing
- Area of Reponsibility:
  - A spehere of responsilbility, maintained over time
  - e.g. health, professional dvelopment, business development, finances
- Resources:
  - A topic or theme - ongoing interest
  - habit formation, stoicism, cooperative movements
- Archives:
  - inactive items from the other three sections

Question: can these be implemented in my zettelkasten system? can the two live
together harmoniously?

I think they could be, and fairly easily at that. This could be done with simple
tagging. Or these could be kept in index notes.
