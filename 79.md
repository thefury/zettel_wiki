Poka Yoke is a Japanese term meaning "mistake-proofing". 

The classic example is that of the forgotten bank card. In this scenario, users of a bank
machine routinely forget their cards in the machine when they are getting cash. To prevent
this, you can make a loud beep to remind the customer, but that isn't always effective. A
better solution would be to ensure that the card could not be left in the machine at all. one
method of doing this would be to only allow magnetic stripe slides. Another would be to 
force the card back before cash is returned.

Another example would be the clutch interlock that ensures the clutch must be depressed 
for the engine to start. This removes the possibility of starting while a gear is engaged.

This seems to be a method of [abstraction laddering](78).
