# Summary

A productized service is a method of treating what is traditionally a service as a product. Once
the service has been packaged, the seller is then able to more fully systemize the marketing and
delivery of the product.

A productized service has a number of advatgaes over a traditional service:

- well defined client interaction
- reduced time scoping new projects
- generally paid up front
- sales and marketing can focus on the product and not individual clients
- if automated, income is no longer tied to hours

examples of productized services:
- scribe: packages for book writing and editing
- autogrow: funnel marketing packages
- lead cookie: packages B2B lead generation

examples of productized consulting:
- content audit - SEO, a11y, gap analysis, etc.

A similar model would be a retainer agreement.
