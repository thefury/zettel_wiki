:lean:process-improvement:

There are two ways to improve the process in pretty much everything: additive and
subtractive. Additive is the addition of more great things. Subtractive is all about
removing the bad things. Most people tend to focus on the additive side of process
improvement. Subtractive, however, can easily be as powerful. And also ripe for
exploitation as it is often overlooked.

It is all about reducing the chance od a bad performance vs. increasing the chance
of a good performance. It can be easier to eliminate errors than it can be to master 
something. 

# Examples

Baseball: Hit More Runs (additive) vs Get less outs (subtractive)
Investing: Earn more money (additive) vs Reduce lass (subtractive)
Exercise: Do more intense exercises (additive) vs Miss fewer workouts (subtractive)
