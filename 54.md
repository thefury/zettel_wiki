zettelkasten ideas


The power of Zettelkasten is in the links between items.
Each ZK note should have at least 3 classes of links:

1. a link to more general information
2. a link to more specific information
3. a link to possibly related information - can be a lateral leap

A good example of another sort of card is for an argument:

A description of the argument
the points for the argument
the points against the argument

A description of a single argumemt:
1. Header
2. General Description of the Arguiment
3. A list of premises
4. A conclusion

All of these cards can go into sub cards and the like


Write simply, and in chunks

A clear title: e.g. Cognition is the process of contructing being

A descriptive sentence. This is an abstract.


A zettel is a single idea
It should contain references and a descriptive title
It should allow you to move between ideas easily
It should have a cite
The note should contain your insights, not a summary
You can have a separate summary note, possibly
It should be written in full publishable sentences
An abstract or summary is acceptable
