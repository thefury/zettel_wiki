Scope

This course will introduce you to the concepts and methods of taking complex real-world systems and creating quantitative models of the system. By the end of the quarter, you will have gained experience in modeling the behavior of a system, developing testable hypotheses, and using observations (taken from fieldwork or data sets) to statistically evaluate hypotheses arising from the model. We will survey some of the concepts, tools, and methods for developing models based on underlying biocultural processes, as well as the methods of testing models from observations collected in anthropological field studies. We will focus on methods for longitudinal research of fertility, mortality, disease dynamics, population genetics, and other biocultural processes, but the concepts and methods are applicable to many other types of anthropological and biocultural research covering the life span.

After a brief introduction to modeling, we will focus on three modeling techniques. (1) We will briefly examine dynamic simulation models. (2) We will spend much time on developing likelihood models. These are models that can be developed from theoretical foundations and can be fit to real data. (3) We will examine simulation models and techniques.

Textbooks and readings

There are no required textbooks for this course. I will, however, recommend some of the more important books for this course. Most readings will be provided on-line at https://csde.washington.edu/~djholman/bioa526/.

Grading

Your course grade will be based on six problem sets (8% each) and a final project (52%).
Problem sets

The six problem sets will consist of several modeling exercises. Frequently, the problems will require the use of computer software. I recommend that you get an account on the CSDE Windows network, as all the required software will be available on those systems. Data sets and other helpful material will be available on the web site. You are free to use books, readings, notes, and web pages to help you work on the problems. You can work in groups, but I recommend you tackle the problems yourselves. Grades for late problem sets will depreciate by 10% per day, including any fraction of a day late. Problem sets are due by the beginning of the class period, one calendar week after being handed out.

There are two software programs we will be using. The first is STELLA, a dynamic modeling and simulation program. A limited version of STELLA is available with one of the optional textbooks or can be downloaded from here. If you think STELLA will be useful for your research, a full-feature versiotical programming exercises, mle will be easiest program to use, but other languages (Gauss, R, Matlab) are suitable.
Projects
52% of your course grade will be based on a project. This project can take one of several forms: (1) a new research proposal in preliminary form incorporating some of modeling ideas covered in the course; (2) a completed existing research or funding proposal (a proposal started in BIO A 525, for example) that is revised to include one or more of the methods covered in this course; (3) a new manuscript in which you have applied methods covered in this course; (4) a term paper in which a model is developed and explored.
