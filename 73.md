:metrics:monitoring:alerting:

Promethus is a metrics and statistcs gathering service. It is a pull system, which means that
the promethesu server reaches out to a number of providers in an attempt to gather metrics. For
example, each server in KCS is running a copy of `node_exporter`, an agent which relays system
information to prometheus upon request.

*note*: Prometheus is not for looking thorugh historical metrics. It is designed to drop older 
statistics and metrics.
