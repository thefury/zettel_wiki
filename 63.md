# Summary

A filesytem integrity monitor (FIM) is a security tool that scans for changes in important files. 

In general, these tool work by taking a snapshot of the filesystem. Periodically, the monitor will
check the current state and, if there are changes, report them to an administrator. From these 
reports, alerts can be sent if the change is deemed important enough.

For certain industries, for example finance or health, FIM is either required or strongly suggested. 

Examples of enterprise products include [[https://www.solarwinds.com/server-application-monitor?CMP=ORG-BLG-DNS|SolarWinds Server Monitor]] and [[https://www.tripwire.com/solutions/file-integrity-and-change-monitoring/|Tripwire]]. A simpler solution appropriate for smaller servers would be [[9|AIDE - Advance Intrusion Detection Environment]]. 

FIL is also known as Change Monitoring.
