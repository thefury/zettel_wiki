= Summary =

The least loaded scheme is a load balancing algorithm in which traffic is sent to the node with
the least amount of load.

Note: If a naive implementation of this algorithm is chosen, it can have unexpected failures. Consider
a series of 10 replicas, each at 80% load. A new replica added to the system will have no load, and
will receive all traffic for some time, causing the new machine to receive all of the load that was
previously sent to the 10 hosts. Trailing averages of load would force this to happen for some time.

This can be helped through a process of "slow start"
