= Summary =

An outline is a form of zettel index that can be used to write blogs and papers.

An example:

- Introduction
- body
  - [[53|outline zettel for writing]]
  - [[51|differences between fleeting and permanent notes]]
- conclusuion

A good idea would be to automate the extraction of the summary section into
a larger, editable, document. It should include the main link to the zettel


= References =
- [[54|zettelkasten]]
- [[51|differences between fleeting and permanent notes]]
- [[44|Zettelkasten as a note taking strategy]]
