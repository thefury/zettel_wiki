A usersystem  story is a short description of a feature, based on perspective of a person
using the system. User stories often follow the canonical template:

As a <type of user>, I want to <do a thing>, so that <some reason>.

The classic user story should fit onto an index card. This reduces the need for big design
up front and limits the scope of the feature. The move the focus of the card from design
to discussion. The addition of the <do a thing> and <some reason> allow for discussion of 
the solution as well. See [[78|abstraction laddering]] for more info.

Example:

As a mailing list administrator, 
I can create a grouping of recipients,
So that I can send messages to onely the people who want it.
