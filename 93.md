Projects always fall into Areas. A few examples:

    Running a marathon is a project, whereas Health is an area
    Publishing a book is a project, whereas Writing is an area
    Saving 3 months’ worth of expenses is a project, whereas Finances is an area
    A vacation to Thailand is a project, whereas Travel is an area
    Planning an anniversary dinner is a project, whereas Spouse is an area
