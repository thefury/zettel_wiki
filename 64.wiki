= Summary =

A Host-Based Intrusion Detection system is an agent that resides on a host system. The purpose of this agent is
to monitor the host for changes that might indicate that an intrusion has occured. As intrusions into a system
are often for the purpose of performing some activity, a HIDS agent will look for suspicious changes that may
indicate the installation of unwanted software, for exmaple keystroke loggers, botnet controllers, or rootkits.

Common HIDS checks include:

- [[63|filesystem integrity monitoring]]
  - unexpected executable code
  - modifications of existing binaries
  - changes to configuration files
- logfile integrity monitoring
  - ensuring lags are only appended to and rotated properly
  - anomoly detection
- network packet analysis
  - anomoly detection
