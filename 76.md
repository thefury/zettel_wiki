:heroku:devops:incomplete:

While [[74|Heroku restarts all dynos every 24 hours]], this is sometimes not 
often enough. For example, you have an unsolved memory leak.

1. create a job that can be run on heroku - herokustarter - going to make a project
2. generate an API TOKEN for the account to access the application - this is in the account bit
3. add the correct environment variables
4. hook up to the scheduler
