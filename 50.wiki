This can be an important part of learning complex skills:

1. find coverage - least important stage overal, but it gives you a map
2. practice with a project
3. highlighting the gaps

== Initial Coverage ==

Finding initial coverage is an important first step in mapping the extent of the knowledge you
are attampting to gain. Although this step is critical, the purpose is not to teach you about
the topic. Rather, the reason for this is to show you what you need to know and to tie it to what
you already know.

If reading, this is where you skim quickly. If watching videos, listen at 1.5 or 2.0x speed. The goal
is not retention!

== Practice with a project ==

Small projects can quickly set knowledge in the brain, especially for technical projects. For 
instance, I commonly use genetic algorithms to teach me the basics of a new language or programming
paradigm.

An short essay on the topic would work similarly for non-technical topics.

== Finding the gaps ==

While learning, it is important to find the gaps in your knowledge. While essay writing will show you this,
an interesting technique is the Feynman technique in which you pretend to give a lecture to someone
about the topic.
