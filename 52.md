# Summary

The Feynman technique is a method for discovering knowledge gaps in a topic of interest.

This method consists of the following steps:

1. Get a peice of paper
2. Write the idea or process at the top of the paper
3. Explain the idea or process as if you were teaching it.

While you're writing your paper, you will find that you have adequet knowledge of a good
deal of the topic. There will be no problems with this part of the lecture. When you have
problems, however, this will highlight where you have knowledge gaps.

Take these gaps and learn what you can. Then repeat the process until you are confident
that you can describe this process to someone else.

You can also use this technique on writing about what you know nothing about.
Find a good reference and use the above technique. Copy verbatim the author's explanation,
however add your own insights and elaborations.
