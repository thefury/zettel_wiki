As a knowledge worker or scholar, it is important to constantly generate questions that can
be researched. Setting aside weekly time for this research can pay large dividends. Try the
following:

# Technique

  1. Read at least the abstracts from the premier conferences or journals in your field;
  2. Read at least 1 or 2 articles actively, using the [canonical questions](101);
  3. Add these findings to your research log, possibly using [zettelkasten](54) style notes.
