# Summary

An outline is a form of zettel index that can be used to write blogs and papers.

An example:

- Introduction
- body
  - [outline zettel for writing](53)
  - [differences between fleeting and permanent notes](51)
- conclusuion

A good idea would be to automate the extraction of the summary section into
a larger, editable, document. It should include the main link to the zettel
