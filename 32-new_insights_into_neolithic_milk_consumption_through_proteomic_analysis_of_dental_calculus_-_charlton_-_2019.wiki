This study looks at the β-lactoglobulin (BLG) peptides found within British Neolithic 
populations.



Similarly, a large-scale study by Mathieson et al.
(2015) suggests that LP in Europe only became under strong
selection within the last 4000 years. Most recently, none of the
67 British Neolithic individuals analysed in Brace et al. (2019)
exhibited LP.
