As with all deliberate practice, deliberate practice for guitar involves:

- breakng the skill into parts or chunks  
- identify your current weaknesses
- design strategies to improve on the weaknesses
- practice them

We often do nothing but practice repetoire. This is a necessary skill, but it
does nothing to improve where we stand. 

So, find the worst bit and improve it! 20 mintes, no more than 40 minutes per day



# Goals
I want to be able to use barre chords smoothly
I want to have a larger lick vocabulary
I want to have better rhythm timing
I want to have smoother and more evocative lead lines
I want to know more pentatonic positions
I want to know how to solo in other modes, scales, etc.
Singing and playing

Can do this with repetoire perfection or lick solving, etc.

Chunk Practice - one chunk
1. Get it under your fingers
2. Slow and deliverate
3. Without looking
4. Increase speed
5. Stich your chunks

leading tones, voice leading, chord mutation
modulate quickly and easily using diminished 7ths 
There are only 3 of them as they are enharmonic

The bottom note of a chord is also important, hence inversions and the like

Secondary dominants

The dominant (V) can be used for modulation fairly easily
