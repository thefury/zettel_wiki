= Summary =

There are two major types of notes that one takes while preparing to store kowledge: fleeting
and permanent. 

fleeting notes are notes taken while reading, watching, etc. They are on napkins, in phones, etc. 
They are often in point form or are scribbled. Their purpose is to help you write permanent notes.

permanent notes are well-formed and kept in the zettelkasten. They are known as a _zettel_. 

- these have to be in your own words
- they should have a reference or a cite if needed
- they should be complete, yet atomic thoughts
