Abstraction laddering is a [mental model](82) that can be used to ensure you're
seeing the problem for what it really is. It can allow you to find better solutions
to your problem.

1. start with the problem statement: "Make a loud beep when card is left in machine"
2. generalize the problems with "why" questions:
  1. "Why a loud beep?" => "To stop people forgetting their card in the machine"
3. make the problem more specific by asking "how" questions:
  1. "How do we stop people forgetting their card?" => "By forcing a removal before giving cach."

This seems very similar to other mental models or techniques that I have seen:

- The [poka yoke technique](79) in which you attempt to prevent errors and defects from happening
- The [five whys technique](80) for root cause analysis
- In [user stories](81), the sections seem to allow for this type of thought.

The abstraction ladder also seems like a great way to make Zettekasten references. Add a 
more general note, add a more specific note, etc.
