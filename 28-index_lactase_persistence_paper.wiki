== Administration ==

You will choose a feature of humans or primates (whether morphological, behavioural or physiological is up to you), 
and try to explore the explanations why this feature exists and what kind of evolutionary factors have been oppressed 
to explain its presence. Discuss your topic in advance with your instructor or TA, to ensure that it is doable 
(i.e. not too vast or complex to explore in a term paper).

- literature review style of paper. No argument, but a point of view
- 8-12 pages
- 11pt text, double spaced

=== Dental Calculus ===

Studies on dental calculus from European Neolithic populations shows that they consumed dairy products (Warinner et al., 2014; Charlton et al., 2019).
From Bronze Age Greenland Norse settlements starting approximately 5 ka (Warinner et al., 2014)
From British Neolithic Sites (Charlton et al., 2019)
